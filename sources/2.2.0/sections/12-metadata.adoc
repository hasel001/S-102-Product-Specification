== Metadata

//Since S-102 now describes a “navigation product” intended for ECDIS use: (a) ISO metadata files are not needed - ECDIS doesn’t have to read them; and (b) any “extra” metadata (metadata not defined in Part 17) should, at least in this edition, *not* be added to the exchange catalogue. If such extra metadata *has* to be provided, it should be as HDF5 attributes in the root group. (RM Comment 23Jan2023)

=== Introduction
The Metadata elements used in the Bathymetric Surface product are derived from S-100 and from <<iso-19115-1>> and <<iso-19115-2>>. Optionally additional metadata may be derived from <<iso-ts-19130>> and <<iso-ts-19130-2>> especially metadata relating to the sonar equipment which may have been used to acquire the bathymetric data.

S-102 metadata is encoded in two places:

* Metadata used for the discovery, identification, and use of S-102 datasets in S-100-based navigations systems (specifically, an S-100-capable ECDIS) is encoded in the exchange catalogue. This metadata conforms to S-100 Part 17, with product-specific restrictions added.

* Metadata required by the S-100 HDF5 encoding (<<iho-s100,part=10c>>) and product-specific metadata defined by this product specification are encoded at various levels in the HDF5 group hierarchy, as specified by <<iho-s100,part=10c>> or <<subsec-product-structure>>.

//Recommend either:
//(a) deletion of <<subsec-discovery-metadata>> and <<subsec-structure-metadata>>  along with Table 15 “S-102 Handling of Core Metadata Elements”, and try to encode any of their contents that are absolutely //essential described in the NOTE below;
//
//OR
//
//(b) Combine Table 15 and <<subsec-discovery-metadata>> and <<subsec-structure-metadata>> into a new clause (“Metadata in ISO format”) and make it clear that this is encoded as ISO-format metadata in a //separate ISO metadata file. (NB: ECDIS isn’t required to process this ISO metadata file - at most it would be displayed to the mariner as if it were any other XML //support file.)
//
//CATALOG.XML should conform to S-100 Part 17 with product-specific restrictions only (no extensions).
//
//NOTE: S-102 PT should review Table and <<subsec-discovery-metadata>> and <<subsec-structure-metadata>>  and determine which of their metadata *must* be //included in S-102. Then add attributes (or datasets) to the root group, feature container group, or feature instance groups to encode that metadata, depending on //whether it applies to all features, to a feature type, or feature instance. (Given that S-102 2.2 has only 2 feature types, it should probably be the root group, //meaning it applies to all feature types and instances.)

//Above comments from RM circa 23Jan2023

<<tab-s102-handling-of-core-metadata-elements>> outlines the core metadata elements (mandatory and recommended optional) required for describing a geographic information data set. The codes indicate: "M" mandatory, "O" optional, and "C" conditional as defined in <<iso-19115-1>>. <<tab-s102-handling-of-core-metadata-elements>> indicates how the mandatory, optional, and conditional core metadata are handled in S-102.

The dataset metadata is stored in a separate file encoded according to the ISO 19115X Schemas. The name of the metadata file is MD_<HDF5 data file base name>.XML (or .xml) ISO metadata (per <<iho-s100,part=10c,clause=10c-12>>). The root element in the file is *S102_DSMetadataBlock* which contains *S102_DS_DiscoveryMetadata*, *S102_StructureMetadataBlock* and *S102_QualityMetadataBlock*.

[[subsec-discovery-metadata]]
=== Discovery metadata
Metadata is used for a number of purposes. One high level purpose is for the identification and discovery of data. Every data set needs to be identified so that it can be distinguished from other data sets and so it can be found in a data catalogue, such as a Web Catalogue Service. The discovery metadata applies at the *S102_DataSet* level. Metadata in *S102_DiscoveryMetadataBlock* is encoded within a separate metadata xml file under the [[metab]]*S102_DSMetadataBlock* root element.

[[fig-s102-discovery-metadata]]
.S-102 Discovery Metadata
image::../images/figure-s102-discovery-metadata.png[]


<<fig-s102-discovery-metadata>> above shows the *S102_DiscoveryMetadataBlock*. It has one subtype S102_DS_DiscoveryMetadata. This implements the metadata classes from <<iso-19115-1>>. First implementation classes have been developed corresponding to each of the <<iso-19115-1>> classes that have been referenced in which only the applicable attributes have been included. The class *S102_DS_DiscoveryMetadata* inherits attributes from S-102 specific implementation classes. In addition, an additional component *S102_DataIdentification* has been added.

This model provides the minimum amount of metadata for a Bathymetry Surface data product. Any of the additional optional metadata elements from the source <<iso-19115-1>> metadata standard can also be included.

<<tab-discoverymetadablock-class-attributes>> provides a description of each attribute of the S102_DiscoveryMetadataBlock class attributes.

The class *S102_DataIdentification* provides an extension to the metadata available from <<iso-19115-1>>. The verticalUncertaintyType attribute was added to accurately describe the source and meaning of the encoded Uncertainty coverage. The depthCorrectionType was also added to define if and how the depths are corrected (that is, true depth, depth ref 1500 m/sec, etc.). <<tab-code-defining-the-type-of-sound-velocity-correction>> and <<tab-code-defining-how-uncertainty-was-determined>> provide a description.

[[subsec-structure-metadata]]
=== Structure metadata
Structure metadata is used to describe the structure of an instance of a collection. Since constraints can be different on separate files (for example they could be derived from different legal sources), or security constraints may be different, the constraint information becomes part of the structure metadata. The other structure metadata is the grid representation and the reference system.

<<fig-s102-structure-metadata>> shows the *S102_StructureMetadataBlock*. The metadata block is generated by the inheritance of attributes from a number of <<iso-19115-1>> metadata classes and from two implementation classes for the horizontal and vertical reference system. This makes the metadata block a simple table.

Metadata in *S102_StructureMetadataBlock* is encoded within a separate metadata xml file under the *S102_MetadataBlock* root element.

==== Quality metadata
Quality metadata is used to describe the quality of the data in an instance of a collection. <<fig-s102-quality-metadata>> shows the *S102_QualityMetadataBlock*. The *S102_QualityMetadataBlock* derives directly from the <<iso-19115-1>> class *DQ_DataQuality*. However, its components *S102_LI_Source* and *S102_LI_ProcessStep* are generated by the inheritance of attributes from the <<iso-19115-1>> classes *LI_Scope* and *LI_ProcessStep*. Only some of the attributes of the referenced <<iso-19115-1>> classes are implemented.

Metadata in *S102_QualityMetadataBlock* is encoded within a separate metadata xml file under the *S102_MetadataBlock* root element.

==== Acquisition metadata
Acquisition metadata to a Bathymetric Surface Product Specification profile is being developed nationally. The classes derive from <<iso-19115-1>>, <<iso-19115-2>>, <<iso-ts-19130>>, and <<iso-ts-19130-2>>. The later document <<iso-ts-19130-2>> contains description of sonar parameters.

[[subsec-exchange-set-metadata]]
=== Exchange Set metadata
For information exchange, there are several categories of metadata required: metadata about the overall Exchange Catalogue, metadata about each of the datasets contained in the Catalogue.

//<<subsec-exchange-set-metadata>> mixed exchange set structure with metadata, as does <<iho-s100,part=17>>, as did the old Part 4a in previous editions of S-100. Exchange set structure and metadata are different topics and the structure of the exchange set fits better as a new sub-clause of Clause 11 (Data Product Delivery) than it does under Clause 12 (Metadata) (or in a new top-level clause). Exchange set structure is now described in a new sub-clause of clause 11 and the diagram “realization of the exchange set classes” below is recommended for deletion. (RM comment 25Jan2023)

<<fig-components-and-associated-metadata-for-the-s102-exchange-set>> depicts the relationships of exchange set elements (datasets and feature/portrayal catalogues) and exchange set metadata. This figure is derived from Figure 17-2 in S-100 Edition 5.0.0 with relationships not applicable to S-102 omitted.

//We need to correct the S-100 reference to a proper one. (LH comment 7Feb2023)

<<fig-relationship-between-exchange-catalogue-discovery-metadata-and-dataset>> depicts the structure of the exchange catalogue and its component discovery metadata blocks. The structure is the same as in <<iho-s100,part=17>>.

More detailed information about the various classes is shown in in <<fig-s102-exchange-set-class-details>> and a textual description in <<tab-s102-exchangeCatalogue-params;to!tab-pt-locale-params>>.

The discovery metadata classes have numerous attributes which enable important information about the datasets to be examined without the need to process the data, for example, decrypt, decompress, load, etc. Other Catalogues can be included in the Exchange Set in support of the datasets such as Feature and Portrayal.

The following clauses define the mandatory and optional metadata needed for S-102. In some cases, the metadata may be repeated in a national language. If this is the case it is noted in the Remarks column.

The XML schemas for S-102 exchange catalogues will be available from the IHO Geospatial Information (GI) Registry and/or the S-100 GitHub site (https://github.com/IHO-S100WG).

The S-102 exchange catalogue uses the S-100 exchange catalogue schemas which are available from the S-100 schema server at https://schemas.s100dev.net (downloadable archives are also available on the site for offline use). Implementation of the S-102-specific constraints described in clauses 12.X to 12.Y below is left to developer decision as it can be done in various ways depending on implementation frameworks and the requirements of production or application software.

=== Language

The exchange language must be English.

Character strings must be encoded using the character set defined in <<iso-10646-1>>, in Unicode Transformation Format-8 (UTF-8). A BOM (byte order mark) must not be used.

=== S102_ExchangeCatalogue

Each Exchange Set has a single S100_ExchangeCatalogue which contains meta information for the data in the Exchange Set.

S-102 uses S100_ExchangeCatalogue without extension. S-102 restricts certain attributes and roles as described in <<tab-s102-exchangeCatalogue-params>>. These restrictions are in bold type and noted in the Remarks column.

S-102 exchange sets conforming to this edition of S-102 and using a CRS from the EPSG registry may be encoded as category 3 or 4 when the _compliancyCategory_ metadata attribute is populated. Because S-98 interoperability assumes _category4_ datasets, _category4_ may be used for test purposes, though the absence of test datasets and of a published IHO interoperability catalogue mean this edition of S-102 does not yet qualify for _category4_. *Given the uncertainty about interoperability testing requirements and availability of test datasets, the S-100 WG chair and S-102 PT chair should be consulted for up-to-date guidance.*

=== Certificates and Digital Signatures
The classes S100_SE_CertificateContainer, S100_SE_DigitalSignatureReference, and S100_DigitalSignatureValue are defined in <<iho-s100,part=15>> and implemented in the S-100 generic schemas.

In accordance with <<iho-s100,part=15>>, only the DSA algorithm is allowed from the S100_SE_DigitalSignatureReference enumeration.

S-102 uses S100_DigitalSignatureValue without modification. As stated in <<iho-s100,part=15,clause=15-8.11.4>>:

"The class S100_SE_DigitalSignatureValue is realized as one of either S100_SE_SignatureOnData (a digital signature of a particular identified resource) or an additional digital signature defined using the class S100_SE_AdditionalSignature, each of which is either a S100_SE_SignatureOnData or S100_SE_SignatureOnSignature element as described in clause 15-8.8. S-100 Part 17 metadata thus allows for multiple digital signatures, a single mandatory S100_SE_SignatureOnData and any number of additional signatures, either of the data or other signatures."
